# The Croatian Food Shop

Croatians are one of the most displaced people on the planet. Along with the Irish and the Lebanese, Croatians are the only people where the number of people living outside the country actually outnumber the ones living in the country. Even though Croatians live outside of Croatia, they still like to be reminded of home and what better way to remind someone of their home than through food. Food is the one thing that unites everyone and many friendships, business deals and romances have formed through sharing food. This project aims to reunite expat Croatians with their homeland through food.
